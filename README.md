*Metrics Measured*
For these countries, 4 metrics were measured: 
* People in Need (PIN)
 * People Targeted
* Funding Requirements
* Funding Recieved 
 
 Some of these countries did not have data from 2010 all the way to 2024. Others had data that was sparse. 
 The purpose of this project was to explore how humanitarian aid needs and funding has changed over time and for select countries. 

 *vanessa_eda.ipnyb*
 This notebook focuses on the question of "Which countries consistently had the highest People in Need (PiN) between 2010 and 2024?" 
 This notebook aggregated the total amount of people in need for each country and ranked those coutries from most amount of People in Need to least amount of People in Need. The top 5 countries was used to create a visualization tracking the change in the amount of People in Need over time. 

 *tinu_eda.ipnyb*
 This notebook tracked the changes in the total amounts of People Targeted, Funding Requirements, and Funding Recieved from 2010 to 2024. 

 *sayeda_eda.ipnyb*

Afghanistan was chosen because it had the most amount of data for throughout the years ranging from 2010 to 2024, with the exception of 2016 for Funding Requirements. Syria was also chosen because it ranked the highest on the most people in need, despite their data points ranging more from 2018-2024.

How have global humanitarian needs (People Targeted, People in Need, Funding Requirements, and Funding Received) evolved from 2010 to 2024?

*Bivariate*

 What is the relationship between the amount of people in need and the funding requirements for Syria from 2018 to 2024?
 What is the relationship between the amount of people in need and the amount of people targeted for the top 5 countries with the most amount of people per category?
